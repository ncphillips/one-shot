      "content": "It was already a freezing morning when you set out for the legendary “Castle of Madness” – the mysterious castle that is said to emerge from blizzards once every seven winters. Now, as it grows dark, the mountains’ glacial winds of this valley make the temperature seem hundreds of times colder. Both hands wrap your winter cloak tightly around your body, but somehow you can still feel the ice-sharded winds as if on bare skin.\n\nYou squint your eyes down at your weapon and wonder if it has become frozen to your belt. Nothing alive can possibly live in these temperatures, you reassure yourself, pushing back thoughts of the living dead you’ve heard emerge with the castle.\n\nSoon, you can make out the faint ruined form of the castle up ahead. The old crone’s rotting map was right! Your best guess tells you it’s another hour’s walk in the harsh cold. Before you have time to think about the longer walk, you spot a gaping black opening in the snow. It must be a cave. The crone told you that underground tunnels could also lead into the castle. Could this be one? Or is it the lair of some beast?",

In a few minutes you’ve uncovered a beautiful antique mace, its metal head coated in an unusual blue lacquer.\nDigging some more, you realize something – the weapon still has a frozen hand attached to it! A second later, your boot brushes aside the remains of the man’s face! The blue skin is cracked and broken. Apparently, some warrior died wielding this mace.",

The portal lies open and shattered and leads into the courtyard of the castle.\nYou swing under the broken gate and look around. Dozens of statues – most crumbled – litter the courtyard. You see two doors beyond the statue graveyard. The smaller one seems to be a servant’s entrance; the other seems to be a guardhouse door.",

Fortunately, you had enough foresight to bring a torch. Stretching your numb fingers several times, you take out your tinderbox and light the torch. The heat seems to melt your very face.\nTaking a deep breath, you walk down the winding tunnels making mental notes of its rock formations in case you get lost. It seems as if someone, or something, walked these tunnels in the recent weeks. In a few minutes, you see that the tunnel turns and branches.",
